  <h2>Artistic Hobbies</h2>
  <p>When I'm not focused on my STEM studies, I'm usually enjoying something artistic. For most of my life, my creative outlet has been music. I have been singing and doing theatre for around 12 years, and I also enjoy playing piano and writing music. 
  I have also danced for around 16 years. For the last 5 or so years, I have taken up painting and drawing. I started with acrylic and pencil, but I've switched to mostly digital art, as it's a lot easier to transport to and from college! My favorite things 
  to paint are landscapes, and I love all kinds of music, from jazz to RnB and disco to video game soundtracks.</p>
