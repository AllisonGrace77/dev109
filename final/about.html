  <h2>Who are you?</h2>
  <p>My name is Ally Tribble. I'm currently majoring in computer engineering at the UW, and I plan on minoring in music and/or applied math as well.</p>
  <h2>What do you do in your free time?</h2>
    <p>I enjoy working on code projects, singing, playing piano, writing music, painting, and taking care of my plants.</p>
  <h2>What are your plans after college?</h2>
    <p>At the UW, I plan to do a 5 year program to get a masters in CE, and after that, I want to go into software development. I would love to work in the game industry to develop and write music for video games. I also am very passionate about how access to the internet shouldn'
    t be gatekept by corporations, and one of my major goals is to create an open source OS and search engine so people don't have to rely on a corporation to use technology.</p>
