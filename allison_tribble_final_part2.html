<h1>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h1>

<p>Prior to this class, I had CS experience, but my experience in web development specifically was very limited. I have taken classes on Java, 
  so that is the language I am most comfortable with, but I had learned some basic HTML as well. I had never learned about or written CSS or 
  Javascript before this class.</p>


<h1>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h1>

  <p>I built my portfolio from scratch because CSS is definitely the area I am the least comfortable with, and I really wanted to practice 
  creating and designing websites on my own. I feel much more comfortable with CSS after this process!</p>



<h1>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h1>

  <p>The hardest part of the portfolio for me was the CSS. CSS is definitely the newest thing I have learned in this class, 
  and it is very different from Java, whereas Javascript had a lot of similarities in syntax and logic. Personally, I find CSS to be really finicky and 
  when we started this semester, I really didnâ€™t understand why certain inputs were creating the outputs they were. I feel like I understand CSS a lot 
  better now, and I can usually predict the changes certain lines of code makes a lot better. </p>



<h1>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h1>

  <p>This class made me realize that there is a lot more to web development than just the styling in CSS. It really surprised me how such simple things, 
  like reactions to button clicks and other events, require a language beyond HTML and CSS. This class also made me realize that I like web development
  quite a bit. I went into it thinking that I would find web development boring, but I think use of the DOM and Javascript makes web development way more
  complex and interesting to me.</p>



<h1>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h1>

  <p>I would recommend that future students make sure they prioritize reading the textbook early on in the week, so you have time to finish everything. 
  Also, mess around with the inspect button on your websites! You have toggleable buttons for each line of CSS an object inherits, and it can really 
  speed up figuring out what line may be messing up the stylization of your site. Above all, I would prioritize understanding how the computer interprets
  code for each language. Being able to think like a computer and predict what your code will do is by far the most helpful skill to code efficiently.</p>
