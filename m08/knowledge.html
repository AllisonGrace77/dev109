The knowledge that I aquired this week has been all about expanding my understanding of the DOM, or document object model. 
A lot of this week's materials made sense to me from just reading the textbook, as I have experience in java and a lot of
the syntax, logic, etc. are similar or the same. I really liked the description in chapter 5 on nodeLists, how DOM queries
are cached, and other specifics, as that really helps me to understand what the computer is doing, and I can predict
the outcome of code and problem solve better with this information. Knowing about the collection data structure was also 
helpful, but I learned this in a previous course so I don't have any info on what resource taught me that. Usually I find that 
the required resources give me enough information to go off of, and then I just test any questions I have by coding it myself.

Some specific things that I learned this week are how a lot of the specific methods used by javascript to interact with the DOM
work, like getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), and the match() method. I also learned specifics about traversing the DOM, 
such as the parentNode, sibling (previousSibling and nextSibling), and child (firstChild and lastChild) properties, as well as white 
space nodes. Additionally, I learned a lot of small details to help me fully understand javascript and the DOM better, like the small 
differences between innerText and textContent.
